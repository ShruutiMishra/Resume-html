    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Shruti and I am 20 years old. I have my feet in the field of technology as I am pursuing my degree in BTech Computer Science.
       I have always wanted to learn and earn. I am the first one in my family to study Computer Science for my undergrad degree.
       I like to gain knowledge in every field but mostly Computer Science because I dont want fail my exams here at college.
       I am also a very sporty person and I love to play cricket so much that I once wanted to make a carrier out of it when I was a child, 
       I still do.
       <br>
       As of now I am focusing on developing my skills and getting experienced with new technologies. My first target is to learn full stack development 
       and build some good projects for my resume. Along with that I have been learning DSA.
       I continue to strive for the best in Compmuter Science field.

       Thanks for reading!
